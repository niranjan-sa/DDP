# DDP
Developing Data Products Project

Here a small shiny application is created to demonstrate the comparative analysis of different models when applied.  
The user has to select the train set and test set and train the model and predict on the test set.  

The code is in the files `server.R` and  `ui.R`  

Don't forget to check the app at [Quixotic apps]{https://quixoticapps.shinyapps.io/ddpshinystart/}

A presentation to pitch this application has been hosted on RPubs.
